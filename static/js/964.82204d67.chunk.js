I have one year of internship experience across my time at [Susquehanna International Group](https://sig.com/), [Bentley Systems](https://www.bentley.com/), and [Meta](https://about.facebook.com/) in both frontend and backend development.\n\nI am a go-getter that enjoys problem solving and socializing with people. Most of all, I am excited to learn more about the world of technology and how it can connect people.\n\n# Currently\n\nI recently finished up my SWE internship at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.facebook.com/) in summer 2022 and am now back in the Drexel classroom until spring, which is when I graduate! I am currently open to new grad opportunities for 2023.\n\n# I like\n\n- Chess\n- First-person-shooter video games (e.g. Counter-Strike)\n- Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\n- Pool (not the swimming one)\n- Anime\n- Ice skating\n- Biking\n- Photography\n- Travelling\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I learned to play chess all by myself and played nationally in the USCF from 2015-2017.\n- I type very fast. I have an average WPM of 136, and my highest WPM is 163.\n- I attended my first hackathon in 2019, but never presented (we all chickened!).\n- I used to play the piano. I wish I continued playing because I find it fun now, but I definitely don't miss the practice sessions.\n- I have a lot of side projects that have never survived and live in the dark corner called _private repos_.\n\n# I dream of\n\n- visiting all the continents (except Antarctica).\n- speaking all languages.\n- being better than you at Smash Ultimate.\n- you not asking for example side projects because I am far too embarassed by their progress.\n",h=c.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,d=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return(0,l.jsx)(i.rU,(0,a.Z)({},n))};n.default=function(){return(0,l.jsx)(r.Z,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Kevin Wu",children:(0,l.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[(0,l.jsx)("header",{children:(0,l.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[(0,l.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:(0,l.jsx)(i.rU,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),(0,l.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",h," words)"]})]})}),(0,l.jsx)(o(),{source:c,renderers:{Link:d},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
