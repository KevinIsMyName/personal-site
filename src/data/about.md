# Intro

I am a senior computer science student graduating with BS and MS (exp. June 2023) from [Drexel University](https://drexel.edu/), Philadelphia, PA. I have internship experience across my time at [Meta] (https://about.facebook.com/), [Susquehanna International Group](https://sig.com/), [Bentley Systems](https://www.bentley.com/) in fullstack web development and computer graphics.

I am a go-getter that enjoys problem solving and socializing with people. Most of all, I am excited to learn more about the world of technology and how it can connect people.

# Currently

I recently finished up my SWE internship at [Meta Reality Labs](https://about.meta.com/realitylabs/) in summer 2022 and am now back in the Drexel classroom until spring 2023, which is when I graduate! I am currently open to new grad opportunities for 2023. Interested? [Let's chat!](mailto:wu.kevin.2520@gmail.com)

# Fun facts

- I learned to play chess all by myself and played nationally in the USCF from 2015-2017.
- I type very fast. I have an average WPM of 136, and my highest WPM is 163.
- I attended my first hackathon in 2019, but never presented (we all chickened!).
- I used to play the piano. I wish I continued playing because I think I could have been an amazing pianist, but I hated practicing.
- I have a lot of side projects that have not survived and live in a dark corner called _private repos_.

# I dream of

- visiting all the continents.
- speaking all the languages in the world (keyword _dream_).
- learning how to fly a plane (or a helicopter? ðŸ˜®).
- being better than you at Counter-Strike.
- you not asking for example side projects because I am far too embarassed by their progress.
