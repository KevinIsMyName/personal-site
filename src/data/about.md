# Intro

I am a pre-junior (year 3/5) computer science student at Drexel University, Philadelphia, PA. I have one year of junior experience at Susquehanna International Group and Bentley Systems in both frontend and backend development.

I am a go-getter that enjoys problem solving and socializing with people. Most of all, I am excited to learn more about the world of technology and how it can connect people.

# Currently

I am finishing up my second co-op at Bentley Systems and will begin classes in the fall. I will be embarking on my two tracks: artificial intelligence and computer vision. I am very excited to be back in person again!

# I like

- Chess
- Super Smash Bros. Ultimate
- Pool / Billiards
- Ice skating
- Biking
- Photography
- Travelling
- First-person-shooter video games

# Fun facts

- I learned to play chess all by myself and played nationally in the USCF from 2015-2017.
- I type very fast. I have an average WPM of 125, and my highest WPM is 155.
- I attended my first hackathon in 2019, but never presented (we all chickened!).
- I have a lot of side projects that have never survived and live in the dark corner called _private repos_.

# I dream of

- visiting all the continents (except Antarctica).
- speaking all languages.
- being better than you at Smash Ultimate.
- you not asking for example side projects because I am far too embarassed by their progress.
