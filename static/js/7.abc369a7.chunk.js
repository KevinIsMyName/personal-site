I have one year of junior experience at [Susquehanna International Group](https://sig.com/) and [Bentley Systems](https://www.bentley.com/) in both frontend and backend development.\n\nI am a go-getter that enjoys problem solving and socializing with people. Most of all, I am excited to learn more about the world of technology and how it can connect people.\n\n# Currently\n\nI am finishing up my second co-op at [Bentley Systems](https://www.bentley.com/) and will begin classes in the fall. I will be embarking on my two tracks: artificial intelligence and computer vision. I am very excited to be back in person again!\n\n# I like\n\n- Chess\n- Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\n- Pool / Billiards\n- Ice skating\n- Biking\n- Photography\n- Travelling\n- First-person-shooter video games\n\n# Fun facts\n\n- I learned to play chess all by myself and played nationally in the USCF from 2015-2017.\n- I type very fast. I have an average WPM of 125, and my highest WPM is 155.\n- I attended my first hackathon in 2019, but never presented (we all chickened!).\n- I have a lot of side projects that have never survived and live in the dark corner called _private repos_.\n\n# I dream of\n\n- visiting all the continents (except Antarctica).\n- speaking all languages.\n- being better than you at Smash Ultimate.\n- you not asking for example side projects because I am far too embarassed by their progress.\n",d=c.split(/\s+/).map((function(e){return e.replace(/\W/g,"")})).filter((function(e){return e.length})).length,h=function(e){var n=Object.assign({},e);return Object(l.jsx)(i.b,Object(a.a)({},n))};n.default=function(){return Object(l.jsx)(o.a,{title:"About",description:"Learn about Kevin Wu",children:Object(l.jsxs)("article",{className:"post markdown",id:"about",children:[Object(l.jsx)("header",{children:Object(l.jsxs)("div",{className:"title",children:[Object(l.jsx)("h2",{"data-testid":"heading",children:Object(l.jsx)(i.b,{to:"/about",children:"About Me"})}),Object(l.jsxs)("p",{children:["(in about ",d," words)"]})]})}),Object(l.jsx)(r.a,{source:c,renderers:{Link:h},escapeHtml:!1})]})})}}}]);
